### 🌍 One Challenge I Want to Solve with Technology 💻 

One of the biggest challenges I want to tackle through technology is the **digital divide**—the gap between those who have access to modern
digital tools and those who don’t. Growing up, I witnessed how lack of internet access and limited exposure to technology can hold people
back, especially in Black and rural communities. It affects everything from education to job opportunities to access to basic services. As a
student majoring in mobile app development at Southern University, I see technology not just as a career path, but as a tool for
empowerment. My dream is to build mobile apps that don’t require constant internet access—apps that offer offline educational resources,
tech skill-building, and practical knowledge to families and students in underserved areas. I want to help make sure that no one is left
behind in the digital age just because of where they live or how much money they make.
