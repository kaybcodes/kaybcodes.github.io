As part of the Contributor Catalyst Program, I recently had the opportunity to visit San Francisco and Oakland and it was nothing short of
inspiring. From walking through the halls of GitHub‚Äôs headquarters to experiencing the cultural legacy at the Black Gold: Stories Untold
Museum, this trip reminded me why I‚Äôm passionate about both technology and community. 

At GitHub, we were welcomed by PJ Metz, the Program Manager of Student Communities, who led our tour and gave a memorable talk on confusion
and learning. He spoke about how confusion is actually a key part of the learning process which is something that really stuck with me. As
someone still growing in this space, it was reassuring to hear that the challenges we face when trying to understand something new are not
setbacks, but essential steps forward. That talk made me feel more grounded in my journey as a student and open source contributor.

Being in the GitHub space, where so many impactful open source projects are created and maintained, was surreal. It gave me a stronger sense
of connection to the work I‚Äôm doing and a clearer vision of where I want to go. The culture there emphasized collaboration, accessibility,
and innovation all of which are values I hope to carry with me throughout my career.

Outside of tech, I had a chance to experience some iconic spots‚Äîseeing Alcatraz, the Golden Gate Bridge, and simply taking in the energy of
the city. In Oakland, we stopped at Brenda‚Äôs, a soul food restaurant with comforting, flavorful dishes that felt like a warm piece of home.
While there, we had the privilege of meeting Kenyatta Forbes, a Black woman in tech who has worked as a Program Manager at companies like
Google and Mozilla. Hearing her story and the insight she shared about navigating the tech industry as a woman of color was both motivating
and affirming. Her presence reminded me how much representation matters and how far a few words of advice can go in shaping someone's
confidence.

This trip helped me reflect on the kind of professional I‚Äôm becoming‚Äînot just in terms of skills, but in how I show up in spaces, support
others, and stay curious. Whether I‚Äôm debugging code or sharing a meal, I want to keep learning, keep connecting, and keep contributing.
