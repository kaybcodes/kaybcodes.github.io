### 🌍 One Challenge I Want to Solve with Technology 💻 
One of the biggest challenges I want to tackle through technology is the **digital divide**—the gap between those who have access to modern
digital tools and those who don’t. Growing up, I witnessed how lack of internet access and limited exposure to technology can hold people
back, especially in Black and rural communities. It affects everything from education to job opportunities to access to basic services. As a
student majoring in mobile app development at Southern University, I see technology not just as a career path, but as a tool for
empowerment. My dream is to build mobile apps that don’t require constant internet access—apps that offer offline educational resources,
tech skill-building, and practical knowledge to families and students in underserved areas. I want to help make sure that no one is left
behind in the digital age just because of where they live or how much money they make.

### 👴🏽 Who I’d Tell First
If I could share this accomplishment with anyone, it would be my grandfather, who passed away in September 2024. He was a strong believer in
the power of education and always encouraged our family to pursue it wholeheartedly. He saw education as a gateway to opportunity,
especially for young Black students, and he reminded us often that knowledge was something no one could take away. Even though he's no
longer physically here, I carry his words with me in everything I do. T
