Over the past few days, my team and I have been immersing ourselves in the open-source world by exploring the p5.js ecosystem. 
After careful evaluation, we decided to contribute to the Processing4 repository, a core part of the Processing Foundation’s projects. 
This decision was based on both technical curiosity and the opportunity to contribute to a project that’s widely used by creative coders, educators, and artists.
We started by exploring the repo and getting a feel for its structure. Then, we narrowed in on the “good first issues” and found one that felt like a solid match for our current skills.
After reading through the problem, we came up with a possible solution and dropped a comment on the issue to let the maintainers know we’d love to take it on.
Now, we’re just waiting on a response before diving into the actual fix. 
As we look ahead, we’ve identified a few areas we’d like to explore next. 
Issues labeled with bug, documentation, and help wanted stand out as strong opportunities for us to both challenge ourselves and grow as contributors. 
These types of issues often offer a mix of technical and communication skills, which makes them ideal for learning how to navigate a real-world development community.
This journey so far has already taught us a lot about the collaborative nature of open-source work, and we’re looking forward to deepening our contributions and expanding our impact.
