Hi! 👋🏽 My name is Kayla Bobo and I am a Computer Science 👩🏽‍💻 student with a concentration in Mobile App Development attenting Southern
University and A&M College 🐆 in Baton Rouge, LA. Inspired by the soul, sound, and spirit of Southern University, I strive to create with
purpose, passion, and a touch of that Human Jukebox magic ✨. Some programming languages I enjoy include Java, C++, Python, and HTML. I’m
passionate about blending technology and creativity—especially in the areas of mobile app development, user experience, and digital design.
Whether it’s through front-end interfaces, interactive visuals, or thoughtful branding, I love using code as a canvas for expression.
Outside of code, I’m probably listening to music 🎶, sketching ideas ✏️, or designing and elevating my personal brand. I love art 🎨, video
games 🎮, and exploring new places ✈️. Creativity fuels me just as much as logic does, and I try to bring a bit of both into everything I do.
