I’ve definitely made progress when it comes to navigating GitHub more independently. From forking a repo to syncing upstream changes and
submitting pull requests, I’ve been able to apply those skills in real time. One moment that stands out was when my group chose to contribute
to the p5.js/processing4 repository. We found an issue, commented on our intent to work on it, and started exploring how we could contribute
a solution. That one experience helped me realize that I can be part of the open-source ecosystem not just as a watcher, but as an active
contributor. I'm also more comfortable using tools like terminal commands, which used to intimidate me before.

Between now and the end of the program, I want to continue sharpening my skills by working through other issues. I also want to write more
detailed documentation of my process to build a personal workflow I can carry into future projects. Staying consistent with pushing to
GitHub, asking thoughtful questions in issues or PRs, and reviewing others’ contributions can help me solidify what I’ve learned. If I get
stuck, I plan to go back to the basics and remind myself: confusion is part of learning.

Honestly, the support from Emily, Samir, and Silas has been a huge part of my growth already. Moving forward, it would help to have more
conversations and feedback sessions where I could walk through what I’ve been working on and continue to get insight on what I could
improve. I’d also love recommendations on smaller, beginner-friendly issues or repos beyond p5.js that I could explore to broaden my
exposure. And lastly, just continuing to encourage open conversations around imposter syndrome helps normalize the ups and downs of learning
out loud.
