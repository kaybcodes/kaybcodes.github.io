### ðŸŽ¨ p5.js ðŸ’»
Yesterday I aslo took a look into p5.js, a JavaScript library designed to make creative coding more accessible, especially for artists,
designers, and educators. Its main goal is to make programming feel approachable and inclusive by offering simple syntax for visual,
interactive projects. In the past year, 89 contributors were active, with 15 contributing in just the past 30 days. While thereâ€™s a small
core team maintaining it, the community plays a big role. The project is very active. Itâ€™s regularly updated, with recent commits, frequent
pull requests, and a lot of ongoing discussions in the issues tab. Over the past year, there have been 777 commits, and 70 of those were in
just the last month. That level of frequent updates shows it's well-maintained and continuously evolving.The contributors are clearly
invested in keeping the project alive and evolving. Iâ€™d start by checking the "Good First Issue" label in the GitHub repository. Thereâ€™s
also a contributor guide in the README and a community forum that helps beginners get their bearings. Thereâ€™s detailed documentation on the
official p5.js website and GitHub repo, including setup instructions, an API reference, and coding examples. They also have a wiki and
contributor guidelines which make the learning process smoother. Issue tracked on GitHub. All bugs and requests are managed through GitHub
Issues. There are quite a few open items, but the devs respond regularly and categorize things clearly, which helps prioritize whatâ€™s being
worked on. The devs seem responsive and transparent about the status of reported bugs. 

If I were to try downloading and setting up p5.js locally, Iâ€™d expect the process to be pretty quick and straightforward. Since itâ€™s just a
JavaScript library that can be included with a simple script tag in an HTML file, setup would probably take under 10 minutes. The
documentation walks you through it step by step, and thereâ€™s even an option to use the p5.js web editor, which wouldnâ€™t require any
downloading at all. So overall, I imagine it would be very beginner-friendly and manageable. Most of the visible communication happens on
GitHub through issues and pull requests. They also mention using Slack and community forums to stay connected and coordinate work. P5.js
goes out of its way to make creative coding feel inviting. The tone of the documentation, the layout of the website, and even the way the
GitHub repo labels issuesâ€”everything feels like it was designed with beginners in mind.I was surprised by how strong the community and
documentation are. It felt like the project was built with newcomers in mind. Compared to the smaller open-source project I explored
earlier, p5.js is much more mature and better resourced. Iâ€™d probably lean toward contributing to p5.js because of the strong community
support and its creative, educational goals.
