title: Catalyst Contributor!
---

Right now, I’m spending my summer as a participant in the Catalyst Contributor Program at UC Santa Cruz—and it’s been one of the most transformative experiences I’ve had so far.

This program is designed to help students from HBCUs like me step into the world of open source with purpose, support, and real-world tools.
What makes the Catalyst program stand out is how it blends technical skill-building with real community—it’s not just about writing code,
but about becoming a thoughtful, confident contributor in a global ecosystem. It combines mentorship, project experience, and community
building—all in one unforgettable setting. Being in Santa Cruz is a dream. Between the redwoods and the Pacific Ocean, the UCSC campus is
unlike anywhere I’ve been. One of the best parts of this program is the people. I’ve formed real friendships and professional connections
with my fellow contributors. We help each other debug, celebrate small wins, and check in when someone feels stuck. We’re from different
schools and backgrounds, but the shared passion for tech brings us together. More than anything, this program is helping me grow as a
person. I’m learning how to take initiative, how to be vulnerable when I don’t know something, and how to stay resilient even when the code
doesn’t compile (again and again). I’ve also been inspired to think more deeply about what kind of developer I want to be: one who
contributes with intention, values clarity, supports others, and builds tools that matter. I’m still in the thick of it learning from my
peers and soaking up everything Santa Cruz has to offer. After the program ends, I hope to continue making open-source contributions,
exploring the intersection of tech and social good, and maybe even mentoring others who are just starting out.

For now, I’m taking it one PR at a time.
