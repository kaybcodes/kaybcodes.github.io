title: Catalyst Contributor!
---
Hi! 👋🏽 My name is Kayla Bobo, and I’m a Computer Science student with a concentration in Mobile App Development at [Southern University and A&M College](https://www.subr.edu) 🐆 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. I’m passionate about blending creativity and technology—especially when it comes to building mobile apps that feel intuitive, beautiful, and useful. I enjoy coding in Java, C++, Python, and HTML, and I love using programming as a form of digital expression. Whether it's designing user interfaces, creating interactive visuals, or improving user experience, I see code as a creative outlet just as much as a technical one. When I’m not working on projects or diving into design, you can usually find me listening to music 🎶, sketching out new ideas ✏️, or exploring art 🎨 and gaming 🎮. I’m always seeking ways to bring both creativity and purpose into every project I take on.

While I don’t have any prior experience contributing to open source projects, I’m currently participating in the Contributor Catalyst
program through UC Santa Cruz, which is giving me the perfect introduction. This program is designed to help students from HBCUs like me
step into the world of open source with purpose, support, and real-world tools. Through this program, I’m learning how open source
communities work, how to navigate platforms like GitHub, and how to make meaningful contributions beyond just writing code. What makes the
Catalyst program stand out is how it blends technical skill-building with real community—it’s not just about writing code, but about
becoming a thoughtful, confident contributor in a global ecosystem. It combines mentorship, project experience, and community building—all
in one unforgettable setting. I’ve begun exploring how documentation, design improvements, and accessibility enhancements all play important
roles in shaping a project’s success. Even though I’m just getting started, it’s exciting to see how collaboration, transparency, and shared
knowledge can bring people together to build tools that benefit everyone. I'm looking forward to continuing this journey, growing my skills,
and becoming a more confident contributor in the open source space.

One of the strongest things I bring to the table is a mix of creativity, adaptability, and strong communication. I enjoy thinking through
problems from different angles—whether that means designing intuitive interfaces, brainstorming new ideas, or finding clean ways to organize
code. I’m also someone who values collaboration and clear communication, especially when working with a team toward a shared goal. On top of
that, I tend to stay calm and flexible when learning something new, and I’m always ready to jump in, ask questions, and help out wherever I
can. I think all of those qualities will help me contribute in a positive and productive way this summer.

This summer, I’d really like to strengthen my confidence and fluency in contributing to larger codebases and navigating collaborative
development tools like Git and GitHub. While I’ve worked on solo and small-team coding projects, open source presents a new scale of
coordination and structure that I’m eager to get comfortable with. To improve, I plan to immerse myself in project documentation, ask
thoughtful questions, and actively engage in team discussions. By observing how more experienced contributors structure their work, review
code, and communicate in the community, I hope to build habits that will help me contribute with more confidence and clarity moving forward.
I’m still in the thick of it learning from my peers and soaking up everything Santa Cruz has to offer. 

For now, I’m taking it one PR at a time.
