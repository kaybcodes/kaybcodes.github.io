Hi! 👋🏽 My name is Kayla Bobo and I am a Computer Science 👩🏽‍💻 student attenting Southern University and A&M College 🐆 in Baton Rouge, LA. I also have a concentration in Mobile App Development. Some programming languages I enjoy include Java, C++, Python, and HTML. I am currently working on the Catalyst Contributor program at UC Santa Cruz, CA learning more about open source. 
Outside of code, I’m probably listening to music, sketching ideas, or working to improve my business. I love art 🎨, video games 🎮, and exploring new places ✈️. Creativity fuels me just as much as logic does, and I try to bring a bit of both into everything I do.
