### üåç One Challenge I Want to Solve with Technology üíª 
One of the biggest challenges I want to tackle through technology is the **digital divide**‚Äîthe gap between those who have access to modern
digital tools and those who don‚Äôt. Growing up, I witnessed how lack of internet access and limited exposure to technology can hold people
back, especially in Black and rural communities. It affects everything from education to job opportunities to access to basic services. As a
student majoring in mobile app development at Southern University, I see technology not just as a career path, but as a tool for
empowerment. My dream is to build mobile apps that don‚Äôt require constant internet access‚Äîapps that offer offline educational resources,
tech skill-building, and practical knowledge to families and students in underserved areas. I want to help make sure that no one is left
behind in the digital age just because of where they live or how much money they make.

### üë¥üèΩ Who I‚Äôd Tell First
If I could share this accomplishment with anyone, it would be my grandfather, who passed away in September 2024. He was a strong believer in
the power of education and always encouraged our family to pursue it wholeheartedly. He saw education as a gateway to opportunity,
especially for young Black students, and he reminded us often that knowledge was something no one could take away. Even though he's no
longer physically here, I carry his words with me in everything I do.

### üõ†Ô∏è Open Source Projects That Inspire Me
As I learn more about the world of open source, I‚Äôve come across a few projects that really align with my goal of bridging the digital
divide. One that stood out is [**Internet-in-a-Box**](https://github.com/iiab/iiab), an offline web server that brings educational resources
to communities without reliable internet access. It‚Äôs designed for schools and libraries and shows how powerful tech can be when it's made
with accessibility in mind. Another project I admire is [**Kolibri**](https://github.com/learningequality/kolibri), a learning platform
built specifically for areas with limited connectivity. It delivers high-quality educational content in offline environments and is used all
over the world to help close learning gaps. Projects like these show how technology can be used to serve‚Äînot just profit. They remind me
that I can start contributing in ways that align with my values while continuing to grow my skills as a mobile developer.
