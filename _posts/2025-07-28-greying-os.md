At the Open Source Summit North America 2025, Abigail Cabunoc Mayes gave a powerful talk titled ‚ÄúWho Will Maintain the Future? Tackling the Graying of Open Source Software.‚Äù 
As someone relatively new to open source, I found her message not only relevant but deeply validating.  Abby brought attention to a challenge that I‚Äôve noticed: many open source projects are held together by a small group of aging maintainers, often stretched thin and teetering on burnout.
She framed this as both a crisis and a call to action, a moment where the open source world must reimagine how we invite, train, and sustain the next generation of contributors. Even on more active repositories, I‚Äôve noticed how much of the work is concentrated in the hands of just a few people. 
Sometimes it‚Äôs one or two maintainers doing the coding, reviewing, updating the documentation, and engaging with the community‚Äîall while trying to avoid burnout. Abby‚Äôs point about the hidden labor in open source really hit me. 
A lot of what keeps these projects alive happens behind the scenes, and when there isn‚Äôt a plan to bring in new contributors or share that load, it shows.

What really stood out in Abby‚Äôs talk was her focus on shifting leadership models. She emphasized the importance of co-maintainership, mentoring, and creating welcoming paths for new contributors.
That message hit home for me. Gen Z is often ready and excited to contribute, but we‚Äôre navigating unfamiliar systems with limited support.
Many of us are used to fast-paced, collaborative environments such as Slack channels, screen recordings, and interactive documentation.
When we step into a project that communicates mostly through long email threads or expects silent observation until someone ‚Äúproves‚Äù themselves, it feels discouraging and outdated.
Abby‚Äôs suggestion to rethink how we teach and invite people into open source felt like the exact shift we need.
I believe we‚Äôd see a huge increase in participation if more maintainers actively reached out to newer contributors with small, manageable tasks and offered feedback loops instead of just dropping links to an issue tracker. 

From a Gen Z perspective, I‚Äôd add that visibility and purpose are key motivators. When we can clearly see the real-world impact of our work even if it‚Äôs something as simple as improving documentation or fixing a small bug it drives us to stay involved.
It also helps when communities recognize contributions publicly, whether that‚Äôs through badges, shoutouts, or contributor spotlights. And honestly, the more video and interactive content we have, the better.
Many of us grew up learning on YouTube or TikTok, so short video walkthroughs of pull requests or maintainers explaining project architecture could go a long way.
Finally, gamifying the experience even in small ways like emoji reactions in Slack or progress trackers on onboarding checklists can keep momentum going without feeling forced. Overall, Abby‚Äôs talk made me hopeful.
It acknowledged the strain current maintainers are under but also laid out a path forward that feels both doable and inspiring. The future of open source doesn‚Äôt have to fall apart under the weight of an aging contributor base.
With intentional mentorship, more inclusive communication styles, and a little creativity, we can build open source communities that are sustainable and welcoming.
